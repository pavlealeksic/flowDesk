# Database Migration System Fix Summary

## Problem
The database migration system was failing with the error:
```
Failed to apply migrations to /Users/pavlealeksic/Library/Application Support/Electron/FlowDesk/databases/mail.db: 
Error: SQLITE_ERROR: no such table: schema_version
```

This occurred because the migration manager was trying to check the current schema version from a `schema_version` table that didn't exist yet.

## Root Causes

1. **Missing Schema Version Table Creation**: The migration manager was not creating the `schema_version` table before attempting to query it.

2. **Stub Implementation**: The original migration manager was mostly a stub that logged what it would do but didn't actually execute SQLite operations.

3. **Missing Migration Table**: No table existed to track which individual migrations had been applied.

## Solution

### 1. Complete Migration Manager Implementation
- Added proper SQLite3 database handling with type definitions
- Implemented `ensureSchemaVersionTable()` to create the schema_version table if it doesn't exist
- Implemented `ensureMigrationsTable()` to track individual migrations
- Added proper error handling for "no such table" errors

### 2. Migration Tracking System
- Created two tables for tracking migrations:
  - `schema_version`: Tracks the overall database schema version
  - `migrations`: Tracks each individual migration that has been applied

### 3. Robust Migration Execution
- Migrations are now executed in serialized mode for sequential execution
- Each migration is checked before execution to prevent re-running
- Empty migrations (comment-only) are properly skipped
- Version numbers are extracted from migration IDs for proper versioning

### 4. Integration with Database Initialization
- Updated the `DatabaseInitializationService` to properly call the migration manager
- Migrations are now run after initial database creation
- Proper error handling and propagation throughout the initialization flow

## Key Files Modified

1. **`/src/main/database-migration-manager.ts`**
   - Complete rewrite with proper SQLite operations
   - Added schema version table creation
   - Implemented migration tracking and execution
   - Added idempotent migration support

2. **`/src/main/database-initialization-service.ts`**
   - Integrated with the migration manager
   - Updated `runMigrations()` method to use the actual migration manager

## Verification

Created a comprehensive test suite (`/src/test/test-migration-system.ts`) that verifies:
- Schema version table is automatically created
- Migrations are properly tracked
- Migrations are idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)
- Migration effects are applied correctly (tables and indexes created)

## Migration Examples Added

### Mail Database Migrations
1. `001_initial_schema` - Placeholder for initial schema
2. `002_add_message_indexes` - Adds performance indexes for message queries
3. `003_add_attachment_tracking` - Creates attachments tracking table

### Calendar Database Migrations
1. `001_initial_schema` - Placeholder for initial schema  
2. `002_add_event_categories` - Adds event categories support
3. `003_add_reminder_notifications` - Creates reminder notifications table

## How It Works Now

1. When databases are initialized or when migrations are run:
   - The migration manager first ensures the `schema_version` and `migrations` tables exist
   - It checks the current schema version
   - It iterates through all defined migrations
   - For each migration not yet applied, it executes the SQL and records it
   - The schema version is updated to reflect the highest migration number

2. Migrations are idempotent:
   - Each migration is tracked by ID in the `migrations` table
   - Re-running migrations will skip already-applied ones
   - No errors occur if migrations are run multiple times

3. Error handling:
   - "No such table" errors for schema_version are handled gracefully
   - Migration failures are logged with detailed error messages
   - The system can recover from partial migration failures

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Schema Evolution**: New migrations can be added to evolve the database schema over time
2. **Version Tracking**: Always know what version of the schema is deployed
3. **Safe Updates**: Migrations are idempotent and tracked
4. **Development Friendly**: Easy to add new migrations during development
5. **Production Ready**: Robust error handling and logging for production deployments

## Usage

To add a new migration:

1. Add it to the appropriate method (`getMailMigrations()` or `getCalendarMigrations()`)
2. Use a sequential ID like `004_migration_name`
3. Provide the SQL to execute
4. Optionally provide rollback SQL

Example:
```typescript
{
  id: '004_add_new_feature',
  description: 'Add support for new feature',
  sql: `
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS new_feature_table (
      id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      data TEXT NOT NULL
    );
  `,
  rollback: `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS new_feature_table;`
}
```

The migration will be automatically applied the next time the application starts or when migrations are explicitly run.
