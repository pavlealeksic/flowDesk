# Production Security Checklist

## Overview
This document outlines all security requirements and configurations needed for production deployment of Flow Desk Desktop App.

## Pre-Deployment Security Checks

### 1. Environment Configuration
- [ ] **NODE_ENV** set to `production`
- [ ] **ENCRYPTION_KEY** configured (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] All OAuth2 credentials properly configured (no placeholders)
- [ ] `.env` file NOT included in deployment package
- [ ] Environment variables validated at startup

### 2. Code Security Audit
Run the security check script before every production build:
```bash
npm run security:check
```

This script verifies:
- No console.log statements in production code
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Proper error handling
- No known vulnerabilities in dependencies

### 3. Logging Configuration
- [ ] Console logging disabled in production
- [ ] File logging configured with proper rotation
- [ ] Sensitive data redacted from logs (passwords, tokens, API keys)
- [ ] Log files stored in secure location with proper permissions

### 4. Data Encryption
- [ ] All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- [ ] Encryption keys properly managed (not hardcoded)
- [ ] TLS/SSL enforced for all network communications
- [ ] OAuth tokens encrypted in storage

### 5. Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Clerk authentication properly configured
- [ ] OAuth2 flows using PKCE
- [ ] Session management implemented securely
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism in place

## Build Process

### Development Build
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
# Set environment
export NODE_ENV=production
export ENCRYPTION_KEY=<your-secure-key>

# Run security check
npm run security:check

# Build application
npm run build:production

# Create distribution
npm run dist:production
```

## Security Configuration File

The application uses a centralized security configuration (`src/main/security-config.ts`) that handles:
- Environment validation
- Encryption key management
- Logging configuration
- Input sanitization
- OAuth configuration validation

## OAuth2 Security

### Required for Each Provider:
1. **Google:**
   - Valid client ID and secret
   - Proper redirect URIs configured
   - Required scopes minimized

2. **Microsoft:**
   - Azure AD app registration
   - Proper permissions configured
   - Client credentials secured

3. **Other Providers:**
   - Valid OAuth2 credentials
   - PKCE implementation
   - Secure token storage

## Runtime Security

### Process Security
- [ ] Application signed with valid certificate
- [ ] Auto-update mechanism secured
- [ ] CSP headers configured
- [ ] Node integration disabled in renderer

### Data Security
- [ ] Database encrypted
- [ ] Secure credential storage using OS keychain
- [ ] Memory cleared after sensitive operations
- [ ] Secure IPC communication

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Security Monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking configured (Sentry or similar)
- [ ] Security event logging
- [ ] Anomaly detection
- [ ] Regular security audits

### Incident Response
- [ ] Incident response plan documented
- [ ] Security contact information updated
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- [ ] GDPR compliance (if applicable)
- [ ] Data retention policies implemented
- [ ] User data export/deletion capabilities
- [ ] Privacy policy updated

### Security Standards
- [ ] OWASP guidelines followed
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Security patches applied promptly

## Testing

### Security Testing
```bash
# Run security audit
npm run security:audit

# Fix vulnerabilities
npm run security:fix

# Run penetration tests (if available)
npm run test:security
```

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
1. [ ] Run `npm run security:check`
2. [ ] Review all environment variables
3. [ ] Verify encryption keys are secure
4. [ ] Check for any TODO or FIXME comments
5. [ ] Ensure all tests pass

### Post-Deployment
1. [ ] Verify secure connections
2. [ ] Check logs for errors
3. [ ] Monitor resource usage
4. [ ] Test OAuth flows
5. [ ] Verify data encryption

## Emergency Procedures

### Security Breach Response
1. Immediately rotate all keys and tokens
2. Review audit logs
3. Identify affected users
4. Notify users if required
5. Document incident

### Quick Security Commands
```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Update dependencies
npm update

# Rotate encryption keys
node scripts/rotate-keys.js
