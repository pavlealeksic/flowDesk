# Flow Desk Architecture Update - Apple Mail + Browser Approach

## âœ… **New Architecture Decision**

Based on user feedback, Flow Desk will use:

1. **IMAP/SMTP for Mail** (Apple Mail approach)
   - Universal compatibility with all email providers
   - Predefined server configs for easy setup
   - Better privacy and reliability
   - No API rate limits or breaking changes

2. **CalDAV for Calendar** (Apple Calendar approach)  
   - Universal calendar protocol support
   - Works with Google, iCloud, Exchange, etc.
   - Better privacy and offline support

3. **Chrome Browser Instances for Everything Else**
   - Slack, Teams, Discord, Notion, Jira, GitHub, etc.
   - No API maintenance - always current web interfaces
   - Better security isolation per service
   - Automatic updates from service providers

## âœ… **UI Layout Structure**

**Primary Sidebar (Left):**
- Mail button (global mail view)
- Calendar button (global calendar view)
- Workspace squares (2-letter abbreviations: "WK", "PR", etc.)
- Add workspace button

**Secondary Sidebar (Service List):**
- Services for selected workspace only
- Service icons + names
- Add service button

**Main View:**
- Mail: 3-pane email client (folder tree, message list, content)
- Calendar: Day/week/month views
- Services: Chrome browser instances

## âœ… **Implementation Progress**

### **Completed:**
1. **Mail Server Configs** - Predefined IMAP/SMTP configs for Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.
2. **Rust Mail Engine** - Account manager with auto-detection by email domain  
3. **Workspace Manager** - Chrome browser instance management with isolation
4. **Service Catalog** - Predefined service configurations

### **In Progress:**
1. **TypeScript Integration** - Fixing compilation for desktop app
2. **UI Implementation** - React components for the new layout

### **Next Steps:**
1. Complete IMAP/SMTP integration with Rust engine
2. Complete CalDAV calendar integration
3. Implement the UI layout with proper workspace management
4. Test end-to-end functionality

## ðŸŽ¯ **This Approach Is Superior Because:**

1. **Simpler Maintenance** - No API client maintenance for web services
2. **Better Privacy** - IMAP/CalDAV keeps data local, browsers are isolated
3. **Always Current** - Web services update themselves
4. **Universal Compatibility** - Works with any email/calendar provider
5. **Better Security** - Chromium partitions provide isolation
6. **User Familiarity** - Users get the exact web interfaces they know

This matches how successful productivity apps like Franz, Rambox, and Station work, but with the addition of real native email and calendar clients.
